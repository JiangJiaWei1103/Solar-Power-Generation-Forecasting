"""
Model architecture building logic.
Author: JiaWei Jiang

The file contains a single function for model name switching and model
architecture building based on the model configuration.

To add in new model, users need to design custom model architecture,
put the file under the same directory, and import the corresponding
model below (i.e., import the separately pre-defined model arch.).
